An idempotent HTTP method is a HTTP method that can be called many times without different outcomes. It would not matter if the method is called only once, or ten times over. The result should be the same. ... Since POST is not a idempotent method, calling it multiple times can result in wrong updates.
-----
The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, and so are inherently idempotent. However, it is possible that a sequence of several requests is non- idempotent, even if all of the methods executed in that sequence are idempotent.
